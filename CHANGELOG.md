# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.1.0

### Highlights

- Capture activity with the event ingest API and TypeScript SDK, including batching, retries and immutable event IDs.
- Search and follow live events in the console, inspect actors and targets, export results, and enforce project retention.
- Self-host with Compose or Coolify using versioned images, SMTP sign-in and restricted signups for your team.

### First public release

Logbird is an MIT-licensed activity-history platform for developers and operators.
Create workspaces and projects, invite teammates, issue ingest/read keys, and send
application events through the HTTP API or SDK. The console provides a query
language, guarded SQL, saved views, live tail, entity directories and streamed
exports. A worker enforces per-project retention and records maintenance receipts.

The self-host stack includes PostgreSQL, ClickHouse and Redis, with separate app,
API, worker and migration images. It supports Compose and Coolify, SMTP with
required STARTTLS, and optional domain/invitation-based signup restrictions.
The public origin also serves the read-only API reference.

### Upgrade and known limits

- This is the first versioned public release. Earlier source installations must
  follow the [namespace and immutable-ID migration guidance](docs/self-hosting.md#upgrades-and-backups),
  preserve existing secrets, and take matched backups before upgrading.
- Failed retention receipts trigger an aggregate rebuild on the next successful
  run; inspect worker receipts and allow time proportional to retained history.
- Packaged restore/upgrade, migration cancellation and live Coolify recovery
  acceptance remain tracked in [#77](https://github.com/joodlab/logbird/issues/77)
  and [#88](https://github.com/joodlab/logbird/issues/88). Image builds alone do
  not establish those operational guarantees.
